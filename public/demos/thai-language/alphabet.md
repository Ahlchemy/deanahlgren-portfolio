# Thai Alphabet and Pronunciation Guide

## Introduction to Thai Script
The Thai alphabet is used to write Thai, Sanskrit, Pali, and several minority languages in Thailand. It consists of 44 consonants, 15 vowel symbols that combine into 28 vowel forms, and 4 tone marks. The script is written from left to right with no spaces between words, though spaces are used to indicate the end of a clause or sentence.

## Consonants (พยัญชนะ)
Thai consonants are divided into three classes which help determine the tone of a syllable:
- Low class (เสียงต่ำ)
- Mid class (เสียงกลาง)
- High class (เสียงสูง)

## Pronunciation Tips
1. Thai is a tonal language - the same word pronounced with different tones can have completely different meanings
2. Practice the tones carefully - they are essential for being understood
3. Some Thai consonants have no equivalent in English - listen carefully to native speakers
4. Thai vowel length is important - short and long vowels can change the meaning of words
5. Final consonants in Thai are often not pronounced or are pronounced differently than when they appear at the beginning of a syllable
